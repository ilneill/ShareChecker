# ShareChecker
A Simple Script to check Stock Market Share values using Yahoo! Finance

Just experimenting with checking Market Share values...
- What can I find for free.
- keep it simple stupid (KISS).

I discovered the free Python library "yfinance" for accessing Yahoo! Finance data, but it can be a bit temperamental (aka. flakey).

I cannot really complain - "yfinance" is free and easy to use (no API keys needed), but sometimes Yahoo! seems to block it (or at least make life difficult). Try again later seems to be he secret sauce, if you are just learning and experimenting like me.

Enjoy!
